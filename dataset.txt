We use one synthetic and three real datasets. All series are z-normalized (i.e., mean=0, stddev=1) before indexing and querying.
Rand is a synthetic dataset, generated as cumulative sums of random walk steps following a standard Gaussian distribution N(0, 1). It has been extensively used in the existing works. We generate 50-800 million Rand series of length 256 (50GB-800GB).
DNA is a real dataset collected from DNA sequences of two plants, Allium sativum and Taxus wallichiana. It comprises 26 million data series of length 1024 (∼113GB).
The second real dataset, ECG (Electrocardiography), is extracted from the MIMIC-III Waveform Database. It contains over 97 million data series of length 320 (∼117GB), sampled at 125Hz from 6146 ICU patients.
The last real dataset, Deep, comprises 1 billion vectors of size 96, extracted from the last CNN (convolutional neural network) layers of images.
